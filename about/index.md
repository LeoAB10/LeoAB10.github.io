Namaste :pray:, I'm Atin Bainada, a second year UG student at [CSE, IIT Bombay](https://cse.iitb.ac.in).

I've a deep interest in machine learning, specially Reinforcement Learning. I also enjoy looking at stars and studying astronomy and astrophysics. And I would like to work on something that includes both reinforcement learning and astronomy.

I also like watching and playing football (both outside and FIFA :grin:).  
I adore Lionel Messi, he is the greatest athlete of all time in my opinion.
